  short_description: The open source relational database
  description: MariaDB is built upon the values of performance, stability, and openness, and MariaDB Foundation ensures contributions will be accepted on technical merit. Recent new functionality includes advanced clustering with Galera Cluster 4, compatibility features with Oracle Database and Temporal Data Tables, allowing one to query the data as it stood at any point in the past.
  features:
    - title: Drop-in replacement of MySQL
      description: MariaDB was designed as a drop-in replacement of MySQL with more features, new storage engines, fewer bugs, and better performance. MariaDB is brought to you by the MariaDB Foundation and the MariaDB Corporation. MariaDB is developed by many of the original developers of MySQL who now work for the MariaDB Corporation, the MariaDB Foundation and by many people in the community.
    - title: Modern SQL
      description: Support for modern SQL features such as common table expressions (CTEs), Window functions, temporal data tables and JSON functions. MariaDBâ€™s SQL dialect is compatible with MySQL but extends it with columnar storage and other functionality.
    - title: Pluggable Storage Engines
      description: InnoDB, Aria, ColumnStore, MyRocks, and countless third-party engines allow the MariaDB frontend to extend beyond pure transaction processing.
    - title: Columnar Storage for Analytics
      description: MariaDB ColumnStore plugs into MariaDB Community Server for columnar analytics (MPP) or hybrid smart transactions (HTAP).
