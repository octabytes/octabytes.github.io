  short_description: Apache Kafka is an open-source platform for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration and mission-critical applications.
  description: "Apache Kafka is a framework implementation of a software bus using stream-processing. It's primarily used to build real-time streaming data pipelines and applications that adapt to the data streams. It combines messaging, storage and stream processing to allow storage and analysis of both historical and real-time data. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. More than 80% of all Fortune 100 companies use Kafka."
  features:
    - title: High throughput, scalable
      description: Apache Kafka enables you to deliver messages at network-limited throughput using a cluster of machines with latencies as low as 2ms. Scale production clusters up to a thousand brokers, trillions of messages per day, petabytes of data, and hundreds of thousands of partitions. You can elastically expand and contract storage and processing.
    - title: Permanent storage, high availability
      description: With Apache Kafka, you can store streams of data safely in a distributed, durable, fault-tolerant cluster, and stretch clusters efficiently over availability zones or connect separate clusters across geographic regions.
    - title: Built-in stream processing
      description: "You can process streams of events with joins, aggregations, filters, transformations, and more, using event-time and exactly-once processing. Apache Kafka's out-of-the-box Connect interface integrates with hundreds of event sources and event sinks including Postgres, JMS, Elasticsearch, and AWS S3."
    - title: Mission-critical, widely trusted
      description: Apache Kafka supports mission-critical use cases with guaranteed ordering, zero message loss, and efficient exactly-once processing. Thousands of organizations use Kafka, from internet giants and car manufacturers to stock exchanges. There have been 5m+ unique lifetime downloads.
