  features:
    - title: Speed
      description: Weaviate typically performs a 10-NN neighbor search out of millions of objects in single-digit milliseconds. See benchmarks.
    - title: Flexibility
      description: You can use Weaviate to conveniently vectorize your data at import time, or alternatively, you can upload your own vectors.
    - title: Production-readiness
      description: Weaviate is designed to take you from rapid prototyping all the way to production at scale.
    - title: Beyond search
      description: Weaviate powers lightning-fast vector searches, but it is capable of much more. Some of its other superpowers include recommendation, summarization, and integrations with neural search frameworks.
