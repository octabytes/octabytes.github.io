  short_description: InfluxDB is a scalable datastore that empowers developers to build IoT, analytics and monitoring software.
  description: InfluxDB is a time series platform for building real-time applications for analytics, IoT and cloud-native services in less time and with less code, using InfluxDB. At its heart is a database purpose-built to handle the huge volumes and countless sources of time-stamped data produced by sensors, applications and infrastructure.
  features:
    - title: Everything you need
      description: InfluxDB has everything you need from a time series platform in a single binary – a multi-tenanted time series database, UI and dashboarding tools, background processing and monitoring agent. All this makes deployment and setup a breeze and easier to secure.
    - title: Optimized for developer productivity
      description: Everything in InfluxDB — ingest, query, storage and visualization — is accessible in a unified API. Everything in the platform can now be programmatically accessed and controlled. This is combined with a powerful set of client libraries across 10 languages (like Go, Java, PHP and Python). A set of InfluxDB command line tools helps developers develop in a way that is most familiar to them.
    - title: Why developers use InfluxDB
      description: You can choose your own path, starting from the UI or skipping right to the raw code and API. You can collaborate with your team to build and run time series data apps. InfluxDB is plug and play so you can spend more time building the features your users need. The documentation is written for and by engineers.
    - title: Keep your time series data close
      description: InfluxDB Cloud works where developers are already building, so you can avoid unnecessary latency and the cost of moving data by keeping your applications nearby. You can deploy with your preferred cloud vendor, anywhere in the world.
