  short_description: Syncthing is a free, continuous, multiple-device file synchronization program.
  description: Syncthing is a free, open-source, peer-to-peer file synchronization application available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, Solaris, Darwin, and BSD. It can sync files between devices on a local network, or between remote devices over the Internet. Data security and data safety are built into the design of the software. It synchronizes files in real time, safely protected from prying eyes.
  features:
    - title: Data secure
      description: Syncthing does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges it across your machines as soon as they are online at the same time.
    - title: Transparent
      description: Syncthing uses an open and documented protocol. The security mechanisms in use are well defined and visible in the source code.
    - title: In control
      description: In Syncthing, you set up both sides to connect two devices. An attacker canâ€™t do much with a stolen device ID, because you have to add the device on the other side too. You have better control where your files are transferred.
    - title: Rapid synchronization
      description: Syncthing segments files into pieces, called blocks, to transfer data from one device to another. Therefore, multiple devices can share the synchronization load, in a similar way to the Torrent protocol. The more devices you have online, the faster an additional device will receive the data because small blocks will be fetched from all devices in parallel.
