  short_description: Filestash is a Dropbox-like file manager that lets you manage your data anywhere it is located.
  description: "Filestash is a web app, with a free version, that connects to existing storage backend like FTP or S3. It can be self-hosted or on the cloud. It's best for companies that need tools to manage their back-office. Filestash aims to solve the Dropbox problem by abstracting the storage aspect. This makes it possible to bring your own backend or create your own by implementing a simple interface. If familiar with Dropbox, people can easily interact with complex systems without prior training."
