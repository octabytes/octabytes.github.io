  short_description: MinIO is a leader in hybrid cloud and multi-cloud object storage.
  description: MinIO supports the widest range of use cases across the largest number of environments. Cloud native since inception, its software-defined suite runs seamlessly in the public cloud, private cloud and at the edge. With industry-leading performance and scalability, MinIO can deliver a range of use cases from AI/ML, analytics, backup/restore and modern web and mobile apps.
  features:
    - title: Hybrid and multi-cloud
      description: MinIO is a natural fit for enterprises looking for a consistent, performant and scalable object store for their hybrid cloud strategies. Kubernetes-native by design, S3 compatible from inception, MinIO has more than 7.7m instances running in AWS, Azure and GCP â€“ more than the rest of the private cloud combined. When added to millions of private cloud instances and extensive edge deployments, MinIO is the hybrid cloud leader.
    - title: Cloud-native from the start
      description: MinIO, built from scratch in recent years, is native to the technologies and architectures that define the cloud, including containerization, orchestration with Kubernetes, microservices and multi-tenancy. No other object store is more Kubernetes-friendly.
    - title: High-performance object storage
      description: "MinIO is the world's fastest object storage server. With read/write speeds of 183 GB/s and 171 GB/s on standard hardware, object storage can operate as the primary storage tier for a diverse set of workloads, including Spark, Presto, TensorFlow and H2O.ai, as well as a replacement for Hadoop HDFS."
    - title: Built on the principles of web scale
      description: MinIO leverages the hard-won knowledge of web scalers to bring a simple scaling model to object storage. Scaling starts with a single cluster that can be federated with other MinIO clusters to create a global namespace, spanning multiple datacenters if needed. It is one of the reasons that more than half the Fortune 500 run MinIO.
