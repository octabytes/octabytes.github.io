  features:
    - title: Access to files wherever you are
      description: With Nextcloud, you pick a server at home, in a data center, or at a provider, and your files will be there. With Nextcloud running on that server, your data is protected and you can access it from your desktop or mobile devices. You can also access, sync, and share your data on that FTP drive at school, on Dropbox, or on a NAS you have at home.
    - title: Protect, control and monitor
      description: With Nextcloud, you can protect, control and monitor data and communication across your company; ensure compliance with business and legal requirements, and keep your data on servers you own, at all times. Nothing leaks, not even metadata.
    - title: Multi-platform productivity

    - title: Community
      description: A thriving, transparent, entirely open-source community development model ensures constant improvements, free of lock-ins or paywalls, and enterprise support when you need it.
