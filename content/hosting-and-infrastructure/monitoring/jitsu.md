  short_description: Jitsu is an open-source web and app-event collection platform.
  description: "Jitsu is a fast and easy open-source replacement for proprietary analytics stacks such as Google Analytics and Segment. It's a fully scriptable data ingestion engine for modern data teams. It enables you to set up a real-time data pipeline in minutes rather than days."
  features:
    - title: Send data from anywhere
      description: "To instal Jitsu you just select your framework and add a few lines of code to your app. It is built to be framework-agnostic, so regardless of your stack it will provide a solution that'll work for your team."
    - title: Connect destination
      description: When you connect the data warehouse (Snowflake, Clickhouse, BigQuery, S3, Redshift or Postgres), you can query your data instantly. Jitsu can either stream data in real time or send it in micro-batches (up to once a minute). In addition to DWHs, Jitsu can push data to other services (Amplitude, Hubspot, Google Analytics, etc) or call any HTTP-api.
    - title: Transform the data
      description: You can apply any transformation with Jitsu. Just write JavaScript code right in the UI to do anything with incoming data. The code editor supports code completion, debugging, etc. It feels like a full-featured IDEâ€¦
    - title: Enrich the data
      description: Jitsu will automatically resolve user geo-location based on IP address, and will parse user agent to filter out bots and understand the device type. It can also pull data from 140+ external services to build a 100% accurate profile of your users.
