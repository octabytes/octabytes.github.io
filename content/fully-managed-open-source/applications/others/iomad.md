  short_description: IOMAD is a multi-tenancy solution for business, corporate, and workplace Moodle markets.
  description: IOMAD is an open-source multi-tenancy solution for business, corporate, and workplace Moodle markets. You’ll find up-to-date code releases on GitHub, as well as bug tracking, monitoring, and fixes, and open access to all documentation. Following Moodle for upgrades, staying in line with all versions and security patches, IOMAD is easy to apply to your existing Moodle system – and easy to remove if you change your mind.
  features:
    - title: Multi-tenancy
      description: Allowing you to create multiple companies that sit on top of your Moodle installation, IOMAD provides a space where users and courses can be precisely assigned.
    - title: Reporting
      description: Integral to IOMAD is the fact that it recognizes the multi-tenancy and hierarchical divisions defined in each site. As part of the devolved administration functionality, only the role-appropriate information is provided to assigned managers.
    - title: Course Management
      description: Using enhanced management tools, IOMAD picks up where Moodle drops off. With an automatic course life-cycle for re-certification settings, course sharing options, prescriptive learning paths, and periodic activity release through micro-learning, IOMAD can help you organize and automate your courses to your exact specifications.
    - title: Administration
      description: IOMAD is designed to allow tenant-specific devolution of some, or all, administration tasks. Managers can create, edit, delete, and suspend users, enroll them in courses, allocate licenses, and hierarchically access the reporting functionality.
