  features:
    - title: DB Connections
      description: Connect to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server (supports Windows authentication), MongoDB, SQLite (quick open files with drag & drop), Amazon Redshift, CockroachDB, MariaDB, and Oracle (experimental). Support connection over SSH tunnel, for accessing production databases behind the firewall.
    - title: Data Editor
      description: DbGate has a very powerful data browser and editor. It allows you to quickly find or modify, what you need, even when using complicated relations. In most cases, using a data browser is far more efficient than typing a query by hand or using a query designer (but you can of course use all these variants in DbGate too).
    - title: Export and Import
      description: Supported formats CSV, Excel, JSON lines, JSON, XML, and  Import/export formats are extensible with plugins. Support for scripting with JavaScript
    - title: NoSQL Database Support
      description: DbGate has wide support for the MongoDB database. It uses a native MongoDB driver, so it is not limited to table-like views like other SQL database tools supporting MongoDB. Also, it supports the most popular key-value database, Redis.
