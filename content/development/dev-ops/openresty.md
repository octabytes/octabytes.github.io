  short_description: A Fast and Scalable Web Platform by Extending NGINX with LuaJIT
  description: OpenRestyÂ is a full-fledged web platform that integrates our enhanced version of the Nginx core, our enhanced version of LuaJIT, many carefully written Lua libraries, lots of high quality 3rd-party Nginx modules, and most of their external dependencies. It is designed to help developers easily build scalable web applications, web services, and dynamic web gateways.
  features:
    - title: Powerful web app server
      description: By taking advantage of various well-designed Nginx modules (most of which are developed by the OpenResty team themselves), OpenResty effectively turns the nginx server into a powerful web app server, in which the web developers can use the Lua programming language to script various existing nginx C modules and Lua modules and construct extremely high-performance web applications that are capable to handle 1000K+ connections in a single box.
    - title: Automated SSL Termination
      description: OpenResty will automatically create and renew SSL certificates
    - title: Extensible
      description: "Leverage tons of LUA plugins available or write your own LUA code. It's easy and very fast."
    - title: Based on Nginx
      description: Switching from nginx to OpenResty is not such a paradigm shift as moving to, say, Apache or Microsoft IIS. The OpenResty web application platform is built around the standard nginx core, which offers some familiarity, as well as allowing the use of third-party nginx modules.
