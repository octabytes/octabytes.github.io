  short_description: Portainer is a centralized service delivery platform for containerized apps.
  description: Portainer is a lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your Docker host or Swarm cluster. Portainer is meant to be as simple to deploy as it is to use. It consists of a single container that can run on any Docker engine (Docker for Linux and Docker for Windows are supported).
  features:
    - title: Deploy containerized apps easily and securely
      description: Portainer allows you to get your app up and running in any container-based environment (Docker, Kubernetes. ACI) quickly, easily and securely without first having to learn the platform intricacies.
    - title: Easy automation
      description: "Automation (CI/CD) is key to efficient software delivery, but it can be tricky to get going. Portainer's simple GitOps integration is the perfect place to start."
    - title: Simple-to-build container management system
      description: To succeed with containers, you need to give your internal users secure access to the tools they need. Portainer makes it easy to set up and configure a complete container service delivery engine.
    - title: Secure container environment
      description: Orchestrators like Kubernetes are not equipped with identity and access management by default. Portainer makes it easy to set up and manage centralized identity and access management (including RBAC).
