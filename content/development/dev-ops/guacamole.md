  short_description: Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway.
  description: Apache Guacamole, a clientless remote desktop gateway, supports standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH. It's called clientless because no plugins or client software are required. Thanks to HTML5, once  Apache Guacamole is installed on a server, all you need to access your desktops is a web browser.
  features:
    - title: Access your computers from anywhere
      description: Because the Apache Guacamole client is an HTML5 web application, use of your computers is not tied to any one device or location. As long as you have access to a web browser, you have access to your machines.
    - title: Keep your desktop in the cloud
      description: Desktops accessed through Guacamole need not physically exist. With both Apache Guacamole and a desktop operating system hosted in the cloud, you can combine the convenience of Apache Guacamole with the resilience and flexibility of cloud computing.
    - title: Free and open-source
      description: Apache Guacamole is free, open-source software. Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, it is actively maintained by a community of developers that use Guacamole to access their own development environments. This sets it apart from other remote desktop solutions.
    - title: Built on a well-documented API
      description: Apache Guacamole is built on its own stack of core APIs which are thoroughly documented, including basic tutorials and conceptual overviews in the online manual. These APIs allow Guacamole to be tightly integrated into other applications, whether open-source or proprietary.
