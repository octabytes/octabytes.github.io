      description: Parse Server offers a manual backup option, providing JSON files of your data. The benefits include index management, performance tuning, backup and restore functionality, and all of the other features your database provides.

    - title: Choose your own restrictions
      description: You’re free to implement your own restrictions; none is imposed on you. The former Parse enforced a number of restrictions; this was needed with the running of hundreds of thousands of apps, but they are no longer necessary when you’re only running your own app.
