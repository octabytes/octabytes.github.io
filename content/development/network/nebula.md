  short_description: Nebula is a scalable overlay networking tool with a focus on performance, simplicity and security
  description: "Nebula, an open-source overlay networking tool, lets you seamlessly connect computers anywhere in the world. It's portable, and runs on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS and  Android. It includes encryption, security groups, certificates and tunneling, but what makes Nebula different is that it brings all of these ideas together, resulting in a sum greater than its individual parts. It can be used to connect a small number or tens of thousands of computers as required."
  features:
    - title: Highly scalable
      description: The Nebula model is node-to-node, and can be used in as simple a configuration as installing on a computer that connects to a compute instance on DigitalOcean, or some other cloud provider. This scalability offers flexibility for internet of things (IoT) devices, providing public internet access but without explicitly allowing traffic in or out on predefined ports as a firewall rule.
    - title: Trusted, stable, secure
      description: Innovative companies with high expectations of availability and reliability run their networks with Nebula. Slack open-sourced the project after years of R&D and deploying it at scale. Created by security engineers, Nebula leverages trusted crypto libraries (Noise), includes a built-in firewall with granular security groups, and uses the best parts of PKI to authenticate hosts.
    - title: Runs everywhere
      description: Nebula is a lightweight service thatâ€™s easy to distribute and configure on modern operating systems. It runs on a wide variety of hardware including x86, arm, mips, and ppc.
    - title: Mesh VPN architecture
      description: "Traditional VPNs come with availability and performance bottlenecks. Nebula is decentralized: encrypted tunnels are created per-host and on-demand as needed."
