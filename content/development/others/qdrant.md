  short_description: High-performance, massive-scale Vector Database for the next generation of AI.
  description: "Qdrant (read: quadrant) is a vector similarity search engine and vector database. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage pointsâ€”vectors with an additional payload Qdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.  Qdrant is written in Rust ðŸ¦€, which makes it fast and reliable even under high load. See benchmarks.  With Qdrant, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more!"
