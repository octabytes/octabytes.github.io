  short_description: OneDev is an open-source all-in-one DevOps platform.
  description: OneDev is an all-in-one DevOps platform that features Git repository management with language-aware code search, issue management with custom states and fields, and a docker-first Kubernetes native build/CI engine. An alternative to GitLab, it is easier to use and maintain, with lots of unique features
  features:
    - title: Docker-first Kubernetes native build farm
      description: "OneDev has out-of-the-box CI/CD capability with Docker. It's easy to scale up to run massive jobs as pods in Kubernetes. There is transparent support for Linux and Windows containers."
    - title: Effortless agent maintenance
      description: If you do not have Kubernetes clusters, or want to run CI/CD jobs outside Docker, agents can be installed on remote machines to set up your build farm. The OneDev server will push updates to agents automatically to make agent maintenance effortless.
    - title: Set up CI/CD easily
      description: CI/CD configuration is defined in a Yaml file together with your code. OneDev provides a GUI to generate the file without any learning curve.
    - title: Flexible Build Workflow and Pipeline
      description: With OneDev, you can conditional build parameters, create matrix builds by combining different parameters, connect jobs to create pipelines, run jobs concurrently to speed up processing, and run jobs automatically on certain events, or manually via authorized users.
