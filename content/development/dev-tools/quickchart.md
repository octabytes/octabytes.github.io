  short_description: QuickChart allows you to generates chart images of charts from a URL.
  description: QuickChart is an API for generating chart images, PDFs, and QR codes. Built on Chart.js, it's the most popular open-source charting library. The charts are easy to embed in non-dynamic environments such as email, SMS, chatrooms, etc.
  features:
    - title: Hosted solutions
      description: Rendering at scale is difficult and resource-intensive, but QuickChart takes care of the most difficult parts so you can focus on building your application. Purchasing a license also grants permission to modify QuickChart for private and on-prem commercial use.
    - title: Charts to use anywhere
      description: A chart is defined simply by its URL, so you can use QuickChart's API in any programming language you like. And, because the API produces images, you can include these charts nearly anywhere.
    - title: No-code chart maker
      description: If you prefer not to edit charts manually, you can use the no-code chartmaker to create custom chart templates that you can embed dynamically in spreadsheets, Airtable, Bubble, AppSheet, and many other no-code tools.
    - title: Open-source
      description: QuickChart is open-source and dual-licensed under the GNU GPLv3 and a commercial license. Rather than building your software on top of proprietary chart formats, you may use images produced by QuickChart's API for any purpose.
