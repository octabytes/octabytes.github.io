  short_description: Publish your R and Python content with RStudio Connect
  description: RStudio is a powerful and easy way to interact with R programming, considered as Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a one-stop solution for all the statistical computing and graphics. The RStudio is a more advanced version of R that comes with a multi-pane window setup that provides access to all primary things on a single screen (such as source, console, environment & history, files, photos, graphs, etc).
  features:
    - title: RStudio is designed to make it easy to write scripts
      description: As soon as you create a new script, the windows within your RStudio session adjust automatically so you can see both your script and the results in your console when you run your syntax.  Even better is the ability to call up potential syntax options while you are writing just by using the tab key.
    - title: RStudio makes it convenient to view and interact with the objects stored in your environment
      description: In the basic R GUI, you can always list the objects you have stored in your environment. But RStudio has a very useful “Environment” window available.  This shows all of the objects that you have stored, including data; scalars, vectors, and matrices; model outputs; etc., along with a summary of the information that is stored in those objects.
    - title: Reproducible research
      description: You’ve loaded your data on your experimental patients into SPSS, rearranged it as needed, inspected the summary statistics, deleted several cases with missing values, run the model, and observed some very strange results. You suspect there was a mistake in your data analysis process and want to discuss this issue with your colleague.
    - title: Advanced visualizations
      description: Even the basic functionality of R allows you to create histograms, scatterplots, or line plots with only a tiny bit of code. These are very convenient functions for visualizing your data before even starting any analysis. In a few seconds you can actually see your data and get insights that are not visible from the tabulated data alone.
