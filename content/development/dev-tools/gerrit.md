  short_description: Gerrit is a code review and project management tool for Git based projects.
  description: Gerrit makes reviews easier by showing changes in a side-by-side display, and allowing inline comments to be added by any reviewer. Gerrit simplifies Git based project maintainership by permitting any authorized user to submit changes to the master Git repository, rather than requiring all approved changes to be merged in by hand by the project maintainer.
  features:
    - title: Discuss code
      description: Read old and new versions of files with syntax highlighting and colored differences. Discuss specific sections with others to make the right changes.
    - title: Manage and serve Git repositories
      description: Gerrit includes Git-enabled SSH and HTTPS servers compatible with all Git clients. Simplify management by hosting many Git repositories together.
    - title: Extensible through plugins
      description: Gerrit Code Review can be extended and further customized by installing server-side plugins. Source code for additional plugins can be found through the project listing
    - title: Used at scale
      description: "Gerrit is heavily used by some of the world's biggest Open Source software projects (e.g. Android, Chromium, OpenDev including OpenStack), and by some of the world's biggest tech companies, including Google (who maintain Gerrit and invest heavily in it), SAP, Ericsson, Qualcomm, and others."
