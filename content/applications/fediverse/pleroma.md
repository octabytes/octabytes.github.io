  description: Pleroma is microblogging server software that can federate (= exchange
    messages with) other servers that support ActivityPub. What that means is that
    you can host a server for yourself or your friends and stay in control of your
    online identity, but still exchange messages with people on larger servers. Pleroma
    will federate with all servers that implement ActivityPub, like Friendica, GNU
    Social, Hubzilla, Mastodon, Misskey, Peertube, and Pixelfed.
