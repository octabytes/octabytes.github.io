  description: PeerTube is the free and decentralized alternative to video platforms,
    providing you over 600,000 videos published by 150,000 users and viewed over 70
    million times.
  features:
  - description: PeerTube is not meant to become a huge platform that would centralize
      videos from all around the world. Anyone with a modicum of technical skills
      can host a PeerTube server, aka an instance. Each instance hosts its users and
      their videos. In this way, every instance is created, moderated and maintained
      independently by various administrators.
    title: A federation of interconnected hosting services
  - description: 'PeerTube uses ActivityPub, a federating protocol that allows you
      to interact with other software, provided they also use this protocol. For example,
      PeerTube and Mastodon -a Twitter alternative- are connected: you can follow
      a PeerTube user from Mastodon (the latest videos from the PeerTube account you
      follow will appear in your feed), and even comment on a PeerTube-hosted video
      directly from your Mastodon''s account.'
    title: This is just how a federation works!
  - description: Mainstream online video broadcasting services make money off of your
      data by analyzing your interactions so that they can then bombard your with
      targeted advertising.
    title: Open-source, free/libre license code
  - description: 'With PeerTube, choose your hosting company and the rules you believe
      in. YouTube has clearly gone astray: its hoster, Google-Alphabet, can enforce
      its ContentID system (the infamous ''Robocopyright'') or its videos recommendation
      system, all of which appear to be as obscure as unfair.'
