  description: "A replacement for Lemmy-ui with more features, a better design, and more customizability. It includes Photon UI + Lemmy (an Open-source Reddit alternative. Create your discussion platform with Lemmy) With Lemmy, you can easily host your server, and all these servers are federated, and connected to the same universe, called the Fediverse. For a link aggregator, this means that someone registered on one server can subscribe to communities elsewhere, and can have discussions with people on a completely different server."
