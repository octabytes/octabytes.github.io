  description: PostHog provides engineers with everything they need to make sure they
    are building something that people want. This means - product analytics, video
    replays, feedback tools, feature flags, and experimentation. With PostHog you
    can automate the collection of every event on your website or app, with no need
    to send data to third parties, and deploy on your own infrastructure. PostHog
    plays nicely with data warehouses through plugins for import, transformation,
    and export.
  features:
  - description: Customer data stays on your servers. You're in total control of your
      PostHog instance. With self-hosting, you can also circumvent ad blockers and
      browser privacy features.
    title: Keep data on your infrastructure
  - description: You can run PostHog on your own private cloud with one of its install
      scripts, or get running on Heroku with a one-click install.
    title: Private cloud deployment
  - description: PostHog allows you to rely on fewer third-party subprocessors. You
      can host in any region on the planet; optionally self-host to keep customer
      data on your infrastructure, and reduce the burden when audit season rolls around.
    title: Compliance made easy
  - description: The PostHog API and direct SQL access allow full access to your production
      instance.
