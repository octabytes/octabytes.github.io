  short_description: PostHog provides open-source product analytics, session recording, feature flagging and a/b testing that you can self-host.
  description: PostHog provides engineers with everything they need to make sure they are building something that people want. This means - product analytics, video replays, feedback tools, feature flags, and experimentation. With PostHog you can automate the collection of every event on your website or app, with no need to send data to third parties, and deploy on your own infrastructure. PostHog plays nicely with data warehouses through plugins for import, transformation, and export.
  features:
    - title: Keep data on your infrastructure
      description: Customer data stays on your servers. You're in total control of your PostHog instance. With self-hosting, you can also circumvent ad blockers and browser privacy features.
    - title: Private cloud deployment
      description: You can run PostHog on your own private cloud with one of its install scripts, or get running on Heroku with a one-click install.
    - title: Compliance made easy
      description: PostHog allows you to rely on fewer third-party subprocessors. You can host in any region on the planet; optionally self-host to keep customer data on your infrastructure, and reduce the burden when audit season rolls around.
    - title: Full access to your data
      description: The PostHog API and direct SQL access allow full access to your production instance.
