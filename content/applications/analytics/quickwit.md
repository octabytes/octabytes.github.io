  features:
    - title: The fastest search engine on cloud storage
      description: Optimized file format that reduces the number and size of I/O requests, Smart I/O scheduling that maximizes throughput, Written in Rust, no GC, vectorized processing, and SIMD included and Powered by Tantivy, the fastest search engine library
    - title: A perfect fit for logs and traces
      description: Data is stored and searched on unlimited, cost-efficient cloud storage, Search and troubleshoot errors directly on object storage in sub-second, Schemaless indexing and OpenTelemetry and Jaeger native
    - title: True decoupled storage & compute with sub-second latency
      description: As opposed to traditional search technologies designed for high QPS on limited volumes of data, Quickwit is optimized for search on raw data where QPS remains low but volume is limitless. Leverage Quickwitâ€™s core architecture in Rust and Tantivy for optimized CPU and processing power, to execute queries directly on object storage for improved performance at a fraction of the usual cost.
    - title: The technological building block for your log management solution
      description: Quickwit is cloud-native! Easily deploy Quickwit in your existing environment, on-premise or on Kubernetes, and plug it into the object storage (Amazon S3, MinIO, Ceph...) and distributed queue (Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis...) of your choice.
