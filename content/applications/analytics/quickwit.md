  - description: Optimized file format that reduces the number and size of I/O requests,
      Smart I/O scheduling that maximizes throughput, Written in Rust, no GC, vectorized
      processing, and SIMD included and Powered by Tantivy, the fastest search engine
      library
    title: The fastest search engine on cloud storage
  - description: Data is stored and searched on unlimited, cost-efficient cloud storage,
      Search and troubleshoot errors directly on object storage in sub-second, Schemaless
      indexing and OpenTelemetry and Jaeger native
    title: A perfect fit for logs and traces
  - description: "As opposed to traditional search technologies designed for high\
      \ QPS on limited volumes of data, Quickwit is optimized for search on raw data\
      \ where QPS remains low but volume is limitless. Leverage Quickwit\u2019s core\
      \ architecture in Rust and Tantivy for optimized CPU and processing power, to\
      \ execute queries directly on object storage for improved performance at a fraction\
      \ of the usual cost."
    title: True decoupled storage & compute with sub-second latency
  - description: Quickwit is cloud-native! Easily deploy Quickwit in your existing
      environment, on-premise or on Kubernetes, and plug it into the object storage
      (Amazon S3, MinIO, Ceph...) and distributed queue (Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis...)
      of your choice.
