  features:
  - description: You can make many boards for different projects or tasks. Each board
      can have columns to show the different stages of your work, such as 'To Do,'
      'Doing,' and 'Done.' You can also add cards to each board to represent tasks,
      with titles, descriptions, and due dates. WeKan helps you keep track of your
      tasks and projects visually, so you can see what needs to be done and what has
      been completed.
    title: Boards
  - description: WeKan uses lists on a Kanban board to represent different stages
      of a workflow, such as 'To Do,' 'Doing,' and 'Done.' Lists help you organize
      and track tasks on the board. To add a new list, click 'Add a list' and give
      it a name. You can move tasks between lists by dragging and dropping them. Lists
      can be customized by changing their color or adding custom fields to capture
      more information about tasks.
    title: Lists
  - description: A card represents a task on a Kanban board. It includes a title,
      description, due date, labels, and comments. To create a new card, choose the
      board and column, and add the relevant details. As work progresses, move the
      card from one column to another. Cards can be customized by adding labels, files,
      and checklists. You can also comment on cards to provide updates or feedback.
