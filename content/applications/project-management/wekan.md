      description: "You can make many boards for different projects or tasks. Each board can have columns to show the different stages of your work, such as 'To Do,' 'Doing,' and 'Done.' You can also add cards to each board to represent tasks, with titles, descriptions, and due dates. WeKan helps you keep track of your tasks and projects visually, so you can see what needs to be done and what has been completed."
    - title: Lists
      description: "WeKan uses lists on a Kanban board to represent different stages of a workflow, such as 'To Do,' 'Doing,' and 'Done.' Lists help you organize and track tasks on the board. To add a new list, click 'Add a list' and give it a name. You can move tasks between lists by dragging and dropping them. Lists can be customized by changing their color or adding custom fields to capture more information about tasks."
    - title: Cards
