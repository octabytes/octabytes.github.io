WeKan helps you keep track of your tasks and projects visually, so you can see what needs to be done and what has been completed."

    - title: "Lists"

To add a new list, click 'Add a list' and give it a name. You can move tasks between lists by dragging and dropping them. Lists can be customized by changing their color or adding custom fields to capture more information about tasks."
