        and Apple App Store or use the desktop version on Linux. In the context of collaborative

        As a collaboration tool, Focalboard lets users invite others to their
        digital workspace. It also alerts collaborators when any changes are made to
        tasks within the program. The program also displays personal tasks to other
        team members, and allows for comments on tasks. Focalboard is where task management
        and collaboration features meet.
