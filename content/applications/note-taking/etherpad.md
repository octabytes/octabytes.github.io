    Etherpad allows you to edit documents collaboratively in real-time,
    much like a live multi-player editor that runs in your browser. Write articles,
    press releases, to-do lists, etc. together with your friends, fellow students
    or colleagues, all working on the same document at the same time.

        "The capability to edit documents collaboratively in real time. This\
        \ is made possible by the platform\u2019s powerful feature called \u201Cpad\u201D\
        , a collaborative document which users can easily create online. After setting\
        \ up a pad, the system will generate a URL that users can share with the rest\
        \ of their team. The URL link can be used by the team members to access the\
        \ pad and join discussions as well as activities within it."

        Etherpad comes with built-in chat functionality that supports constant
        and seamless communication between users. In each pad you create, there will
        be a chatbox which team members can use to communicate and make discussions.
        An invite option is also available so team members can invite other users interested
        or need to join the pad.

        "The platform comes loaded with tons of plugins, which allow users\
        \ to shape, develop and even expand Etherpad. This also makes the platform highly\
        \ customizable and configurable. Meaning to say, users can tailor the application\
        \ to function according to their organization\u2019s existing processes and\
        \ workflows."
