    - title: Powerful “Pad” Feature
      description: The capability to edit documents collaboratively in real time. This is made possible by the platform’s powerful feature called “pad”, a collaborative document which users can easily create online. After setting up a pad, the system will generate a URL that users can share with the rest of their team. The URL link can be used by the team members to access the pad and join discussions as well as activities within it.
    - title: Built-in Chat Functionality
      description: Etherpad comes with built-in chat functionality that supports constant and seamless communication between users. In each pad you create, there will be a chatbox which team members can use to communicate and make discussions. An invite option is also available so team members can invite other users interested or need to join the pad.
    - title: Broad Array of Plugins
      description: The platform comes loaded with tons of plugins, which allow users to shape, develop and even expand Etherpad. This also makes the platform highly customizable and configurable. Meaning to say, users can tailor the application to function according to their organization’s existing processes and workflows.
