  description: Joomla, also spelled Joomla! and sometimes abbreviated as J!, is a
    free, open-source content management system for publishing web content on websites.
    Web content applications include discussion forums, photo galleries, e-commerce
    and user communities, and numerous other web-based applications.
  features:
  - description: Joomla has thousands of verified third-party extensions and high-quality
      templates (many of them free). Many templates provide a GUI that allows you
      to change colors, fonts, layouts and features without touching a line of code.
    title: Flexible, extendable, customizable
  - description: Joomla has powerful SEO tools built and ready right out of the box.
      When you create an article or menu item, Joomla automatically creates an alias
      for its default PHP string so that the links to particular pages are both user
      and search-engine friendly.
    title: Search-engine optimized out of the box
  - description: Joomla is created, maintained and supported by a unique volunteer
      community who believe that it should be freely available to everyone, always.
      Joomla is also surrounded by an extensive ecosystem of extension developers,
      designers, integrators, copywriters, support personnel, system/server administrators,
      and people from all walks of IT life.
    title: Free forever
  - description: With a robust codebase, Joomla features built-in two-factor authentication
      and extensive access control levels. Its Security Strike Team has a reputation
      for releasing patches before exploits are widely known in the wild.
    title: Strongly secure
