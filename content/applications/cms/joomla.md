  short_description: Joomla is an award-winning content management system for building websites and powerful online applications.
  description: Joomla, also spelled Joomla! and sometimes abbreviated as J!, is a free, open-source content management system for publishing web content on websites. Web content applications include discussion forums, photo galleries, e-commerce and user communities, and numerous other web-based applications.
  features:
    - title: Flexible, extendable, customizable
      description: Joomla has thousands of verified third-party extensions and high-quality templates (many of them free). Many templates provide a GUI that allows you to change colors, fonts, layouts and features without touching a line of code.
    - title: Search-engine optimized out of the box
      description: Joomla has powerful SEO tools built and ready right out of the box. When you create an article or menu item, Joomla automatically creates an alias for its default PHP string so that the links to particular pages are both user and search-engine friendly.
    - title: Free forever
      description: Joomla is created, maintained and supported by a unique volunteer community who believe that it should be freely available to everyone, always. Joomla is also surrounded by an extensive ecosystem of extension developers, designers, integrators, copywriters, support personnel, system/server administrators, and people from all walks of IT life.
    - title: Strongly secure
      description: With a robust codebase, Joomla features built-in two-factor authentication and extensive access control levels. Its Security Strike Team has a reputation for releasing patches before exploits are widely known in the wild.
