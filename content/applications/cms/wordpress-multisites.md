  short_description: WordPress Multisite is a version of WordPress that allows you to run multiple sites off a single installation of WordPress.
  description: WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Multisite is a type of WordPress installation that allows you to create and manage a network of multiple websites from a single WordPress dashboard. This lets you easily make changes and keep your websites updated from one place. You can create a multisite network alone or add other users who can create their own sites inside your network, limiting them from accessing more powerful WordPress features.
  features:
    - title: Many sites, one dashboard
      description: WordPress multisite networks are a great option for those wanting to manage separate websites from one dashboard. Multisite networks are used by corporations, schools, universities, news outlets, online businesses, etc. You can also create your own blogging platform (network of blogs) on a single multisite installation.
    - title: Choose a number…
      description: You can host a virtually unlimited number of sites in a Multisite setup, thus saving the expense and time of creating separate web hosting accounts and individual websites that need to be managed on their own. The number of sites and amount of content they can contain are limited only by the resources, such as storage and bandwidth, available to the main site through its hosting provider.
    - title: Lots of uses
      description: Multisite can be used for various purposes. 1) Education portals can create a single “hub” site that hosts the websites of multiple instructors or classes so that students can get a consistent experience across all of them, and instructors don’t need to direct students to their own personal sites. 2) It can be useful for training users in coding, etc, by making it possible to set up multiple test sites under one master site. 3) Design businesses and other kinds of companies can provide clients with a managed site for blogging or other purposes related to doing business with the parent company. 4) Multisite can be used to set up a commercial web network in which users pay a subscription fee to have their own site hosted in the network. Finally, 5) A company with multiple employees or contractors who deal independently with customers or clients might use Multisite to allow each of these professionals to set up an individual site under the brand of the main site.
    - title: Built-in blog, ready to go
      description: Since WordPress was originally created as a blogging platform, blogging capabilities are built in and easy to integrate, if desired. It's also easy to set up RSS/email subscriptions to your blog and commenting capabilities, and automatically add the most recent blog posts to other pages of the site (your home page, for example). This helps to extend your reach and make your site more dynamic and interactive.
