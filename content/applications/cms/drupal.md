    Drupal, a content management software, was used to make many of the
    websites and applications you use every day. It has great standard features, but
    stands out for its flexibility. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured
    content for a dynamic web experience. It's also a great choice for creating integrated
    digital frameworks. Drupal provides a back-end framework for at least 13% of the
    top 10,000 websites worldwide, from personal blogs to corporate, political and
    government sites.

        One of Drupal's major selling points is its ability to create and
        manage a wide variety of content types, including videos, polls, blogs, podcasts
        and statistics. It thus enables a flexible design platform to create content-rich
        websites for a variety of different markets. The script also includes capabilities
        of design elements editing, which makes it easy to create both simple and complicated
        webpage configurations.

        In addition to being flexible, Drupal is highly customizable. With
        16,000+ modules and plug-ins, it allows you to modify, adjust and implement
        a wide array of additional custom features into your website, such as CRM, security,
        social media and SEO.

        Another major strength of Drupal is that it is highly scalable. You
        can exponentially grow the number of your webpages without changing a thing.
        Drupal is thus great at accommodating content growth. It's also great at alternating
        between periods of constant traffic and high traffic spikes, which is why it's
        used by weather.com and whitehouse.gov.

        Last, but far from least, Drupal has a very good track record in
        security. The CMS is highly secure and offers regular patches and safeguarding
        from exploits, making it great for enterprise clients. Drupal has an organized
        process for investigating, verifying and publishing possible security problems.
        The security team works constantly with the community to address security issues
        as they arise.
