        Typesense allows you to pin specific records in a particular position
        to feature or merchandize them, and show results for 'pants' when users search
        for 'trousers', or vice-versa, when you define them as synonyms.

        You can store multiple users' data in a single index, create API
        keys for each user that restrict access to just their data, sort records on
        the fly by any fields in your document (eg, sort by price, popularity, etc).
        No duplicate indices are needed.
