It's typo-tolerant and optimized for instant sub-50ms searches, while providing an intuitive developer experience. The aim of the Typesense team is to reduce the time-to-market for developers to build a blazing-fast search experience that provides relevant results out-of-the-box, without breaking the bank and without operational overhead."
  features:
    - title: Typo tolerance & tunable ranking
      description: Spelling mistakes are not a problem with Typesense. It automatically tries to correct typos. You can tailor your results to perfection via flexible and fast query-time sorting.
    - title: Result pinning & synonyms
      description: "Typesense allows you to pin specific records in a particular position to feature or merchandize them, and show results for 'pants' when users search for 'trousers', or vice-versa, when you define them as synonyms."
    - title: Multi-tenant API keys & dynamic sorting
      description: "You can store multiple users' data in a single index, create API keys for each user that restrict access to just their data, sort records on the fly by any fields in your document (eg, sort by price, popularity, etc). No duplicate indices are needed."
    - title: Easy, high availability & federated search
      description: With Typesense, you can build a resilient production-grade search service with a few simple steps, and search one or more collections in a single query â€“ eg, search for both products and brands, given a single search query.
