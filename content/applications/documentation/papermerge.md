    Papermerge DMS or simply Papermerge is an open source document management
    system designed to work with scanned documents (also called digital archives).
    It extracts text from your scans using OCR, indexes them, and prepares them for
    full-text search. Papermerge provides the look and feel of modern desktop file
    browsers. It has features like a dual panel document browser, drags and drop,
    tags, hierarchical folders, and full-text search so that you can efficiently store
    and organize your documents.

        from scanned documents, PDF, JPEG, and TIFF files. The extracted text is then
        parsed and indexed to help you quickly find any document based on its content.
