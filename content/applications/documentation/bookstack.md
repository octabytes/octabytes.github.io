  short_description: BookStack is a platform to create documentation/wiki content built with PHP & Laravel.
  description: BookStack is a free, open-source, opinionated wiki system that provides a pleasant, simple, out-of-the-box experience. Based on Laravel, a PHP framework, BookStack is released under the MIT License. It uses the ideas of books to organize pages and store information. New users should find the experience intuitive. Only basic word-processing skills should be required to get involved in creating content on BookStack.
  features:
    - title: Searchable and connected
      description: The content in BookStack is fully searchable. You are able to search at book level or across all books, chapters and pages. The ability to link directly to any paragraph allows you to keep your documentation connected.
    - title: Simple requirements
      description: BookStack is built using PHP, on top of the Laravel framework, and uses MySQL to store data. With performance in mind, it can run happily on a $5 Digital Ocean VPS.
    - title: Powerful features
      description: On top of the powerful search and linking, there is also cross-book sorting, page revisions and image management. A full role and permission system allows you to lock down content and actions as required.
    - title: Integrated authentication
      description: As well as the default email/password log-in, social providers such as GitHub, Google, Slack, AzureAD and more can be used. Okta, SAML2 and LDAP options are available for enterprise environments.
