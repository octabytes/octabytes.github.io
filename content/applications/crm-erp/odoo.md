      of trading businesses. It reduces the time spent by individual departments on
      daily business operations. In addition, it improves employee efficiency by minimizing
      the manual monitoring of tasks.

      are highly visualized. For instance, if the ERP system is integrated with the
      project management tool, employees can easily view the tasks of their colleagues.
      Transparency in the workflow of an enterprise leads to better productivity and
      relationship management.
