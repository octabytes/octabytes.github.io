  short_description: Vaultwarden is an open-source password management application that can be self-hosted and run on your infrastructure.
  description: "Vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden server implementation written in Rust. It's compatible with the official Bitwarden clients, and is ideal for self-hosted deployments where running the official resource-heavy service is undesirable. Development of features that are mainly useful to larger organizations (e.g. single sign-on, directory syncing, etc) is not a priority."
  features:
    - title: Secure passwords from any location or device
      description: Vaultwarden gives you power to create and manage unique passwords, so you can strengthen privacy and boost productivity online from any device or location.
    - title: Enterprise-grade security and compliance
      description: You can protect your online data using a password manager you can trust. Vaultwarden conducts regular third-party security audits and is compliant with Privacy Shield, HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 security standards.
    - title: End-to-end encryption
      description: Your private information is protected with end-to-end encryption before it leaves your device.
    - title: Open-source transparency
      description: Bitwarden source code, features and infrastructure security are vetted and improved by the global community.
