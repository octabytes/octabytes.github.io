  description: "Vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden server implementation written in Rust. It's compatible with the official Bitwarden clients, and is ideal for self-hosted deployments where running the official resource-heavy service is undesirable. Development of features that are mainly useful to larger organizations (e.g. single sign-on, directory syncing, etc) is not a priority."
