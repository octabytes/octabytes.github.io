    Password Pusher is an application to communicate passwords over the
    web. Links to passwords expire after a certain number of views and/or time has
    passed. With Password Pusher, you can create a unique, one-time URL that will
    expire after a certain amount of time or after it has been accessed a certain
    number of times, ensuring that your information remains private and secure. It
    is often used by individuals and organizations to share login credentials or other
    sensitive data with colleagues, clients, or partners.
