        LobeChat now supports OpenAI's latest gpt-4-vision model with visual
        recognition capabilities, a multimodal intelligence that can perceive visuals.
        Users can easily upload or drag and drop images into the dialogue box, and the
        agent will be able to recognize the content of the images and engage in intelligent
        conversation based on this, creating smarter and more diversified chat scenarios.

        LobeChat supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies,
        enabling our application to convert text messages into clear voice outputs,
        allowing users to interact with our conversational agent as if they were talking
        to a real person. Users can choose from a variety of voices to pair with the
        agent.

        With support for the latest text-to-image generation technology,
        LobeChat now allows users to invoke image creation tools directly within conversations
        with the agent. By leveraging the capabilities of AI tools such as DALL-E 3,
        MidJourney, and Pollinations, the agents are now equipped to transform your
        ideas into images.

        The plugin ecosystem of LobeChat is a significant extension of its
        core functionalities, greatly enhancing the practicality and flexibility of
        ChatGPT. By leveraging plugins, ChatGPT can perform real-time information retrieval
        and processing, such as automatically fetching the latest news headlines to
        provide users with immediate and relevant information. Moreover, these plugins
        are not limited to news aggregation but can also extend to other practical functions,
        such as quick document retrieval, e-commerce platform data access, and various
        third-party services.
