        Unlike sites like Imgur, Vimeo, or SoundCloud which only allow you
        to share specific types of files, PicoShare lets you share any file of any size.
      title: No file restrictions
    - description:
        If you upload media like images, video, or audio, PicoShare never
        forces you to wait on re-encoding. You get a direct download link as soon as
        you upload the file, and PicoShare never resizes or re-encodes your file.
