  short_description: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.
  description: Discourse is an open-source Internet forum and mailing-list management software application. It's an attempt to reimagine what a modern Internet discussion forum should be in a world of ubiquitous smartphones, tablets, Facebook and Twitter. You can use it as a mailing list, discussion forum, long-form chatroom, and more. It can be self-hosted.
  features:
    - title: Conversations, not pages
      description: Why break conversations into awkward and arbitrary pages, where you have to constantly find the Next Page button? We’ve replaced all that with the power of just-in-time loading. Want to read more? Keep scrolling down.
    - title: Dynamic notifications
      description: When someone quotes your post, we’ll notify you. When someone mentions your @name, we’ll notify you. When someone replies to your post… well, you get the idea. And if you’re not around, we’ll email you, too.
    - title: Simple, but with context
      description: Discourse is a simple, flat forum, where replies flow down the page in a line. Expand context at the bottom and top of each post, and also in quotes, to reveal the full conversation without losing your place.
    - title: Links automatically expand
      description: Want to share a cool link you found? Just paste it in on a single line and we’ll make it awesome. Links to Wikipedia, YouTube, Amazon, GitHub, Twitter, Flickr, and hundreds of other popular websites automatically expand to provide additional context and information.
