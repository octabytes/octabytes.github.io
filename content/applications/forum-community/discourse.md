    Discourse is an open-source Internet forum and mailing-list management
    software application. It's an attempt to reimagine what a modern Internet discussion
    forum should be in a world of ubiquitous smartphones, tablets, Facebook and Twitter.
    You can use it as a mailing list, discussion forum, long-form chatroom, and more.
    It can be self-hosted.

        "Why break conversations into awkward and arbitrary pages, where\
        \ you have to constantly find the Next Page button? We\u2019ve replaced all\
        \ that with the power of just-in-time loading. Want to read more? Keep scrolling\
        \ down."
      title: Conversations, not pages
    - description:
        "When someone quotes your post, we\u2019ll notify you. When someone\
        \ mentions your @name, we\u2019ll notify you. When someone replies to your post\u2026\
        \ well, you get the idea. And if you\u2019re not around, we\u2019ll email you,\
        \ too."

        Discourse is a simple, flat forum, where replies flow down the page
        in a line. Expand context at the bottom and top of each post, and also in quotes,
        to reveal the full conversation without losing your place.
      title: Simple, but with context
    - description:
        "Want to share a cool link you found? Just paste it in on a single\
        \ line and we\u2019ll make it awesome. Links to Wikipedia, YouTube, Amazon,\
        \ GitHub, Twitter, Flickr, and hundreds of other popular websites automatically\
        \ expand to provide additional context and information."
