It provides real-time control that makes it easy to manage the movement of data between any source and any destination. It is data source agnostic, supporting disparate and distributed sources of differing formats, schemas, protocols, speeds, and sizes such as machines, geo-location devices, click streams, files, social feeds, log files and videos, and more."
