  features:
    - title: "Browser-based flow editing"
      description: "Node-RED makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette. Flows can be deployed to the runtime in a single click. JavaScript functions can be created using a rich text editor. A built-in library allows you to save useful functions, templates or flows for reuse."

    - title: "Built on Node.js"
      description: "The light-weight runtime is built on Node.js, taking full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model. This makes it ideal to run at the edge of the network on low-cost hardware such as the Raspberry Pi as well as in the cloud. With over 225,000 modules in Node's package repository, it is easy to extend the range of palette nodes to add new capabilities."

    - title: "Social development"
      description: "The flows created in Node-RED are stored using JSON which can be easily imported and exported for sharing with others. An online flow library allows you to share your best flows with the world."
