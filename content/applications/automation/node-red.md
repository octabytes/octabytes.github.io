    Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices,
    APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. Its browser-based editor
    makes it easy to wire together flows. It lets you draw a visual representation
    of how messages should flow through the application.
  features:

        Node-RED makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range
        of nodes in the palette. Flows can be deployed to the runtime in a single click.
        JavaScript functions can be created using a rich text editor. A built-in library
        allows you to save useful functions, templates or flows for reuse.

        The light-weight runtime is built on Node.js, taking full advantage
        of its event-driven, non-blocking model. This makes it ideal to run at the edge
        of the network on low-cost hardware such as the Raspberry Pi as well as in the
        cloud. With over 225,000 modules in Node's package repository, it is easy to
        extend the range of palette nodes to add new capabilities.

        The flows created in Node-RED are stored using JSON which can be
        easily imported and exported for sharing with others. An online flow library
        allows you to share your best flows with the world.
