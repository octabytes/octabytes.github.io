  description: When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable,
    versionable, testable, and collaborative. Use Airflow to author workflows as directed
    acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an
    array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line
    utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface
    makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress,
    and troubleshoot issues when needed.
  features:
  - description: No more command-line or XML black-magic! Use standard Python features
      to create your workflows, including date time formats for scheduling and loops
      to dynamically generate tasks. This allows you to maintain full flexibility
      when building your workflows.
    title: Pure Python
  - description: Monitor, schedule and manage your workflows via a robust and modern
      web application. No need to learn old, cron-like interfaces. You always have
      full insight into the status and logs of completed and ongoing tasks.
    title: Useful UI
  - description: Airflow provides many plug-and-play operators that are ready to execute
      your tasks on Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and
      many other third-party services. This makes Airflow easy to apply to current
      infrastructure and extend to next-gen technologies.
    title: Robust Integrations
  - description: Anyone with Python knowledge can deploy a workflow. Apache Airflow
      does not limit the scope of your pipelines; you can use it to build ML models,
      transfer data, manage your infrastructure, and more.
