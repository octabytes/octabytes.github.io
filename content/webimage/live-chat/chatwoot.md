    Chatwoot is an alternative to Intercom, Zendesk and Salesforce Service
    Cloud. As well as helping to ensure a great customer experience, it increases
    your support team's productivity and provides them with actionable data. It integrates
    with multiple conversation channels like website live-chat, email, Facebook pages,
    Twitter handles, WhatsApp, etc. It displays conversation from different channels,
    thereby building a single view of the customer, with no need to switch between
    tools. Mobile apps for Chatwoot (available for Android and iOS) enable you to
    browse conversations, reply to messages and collaborate with the team.
