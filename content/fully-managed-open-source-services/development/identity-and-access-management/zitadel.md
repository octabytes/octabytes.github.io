  short_description: Zitadel is a cloud-native Identity & Access Management platform built for the cloud era.
  description: ZITADEL gives developers all they need to integrate identity management. Easy as pie. Ready when you are — because serverless. At yours or ours — because of the open source.
  features:
    - title: Identity management that works for you
      description: "Do you want to auth that's quickly set up like Auth0 but open source like Keycloak? Look no further — ZITADEL combines the ease of Auth0 and the versatility of Keycloak."
    - title: "OpenSaaS: The best of two worlds"
      description: "Open source and SaaS got together to bring you simplicity while enabling you to dive as deep as you like. The serverless architecture enables you to jump right in and scale up as needed. If you'd rather run your own instance on your computer, that's just one command away."
    - title: "B2B: Bring your clients"
      description: B2B is baked into ZITADEL from the very beginning, Multi-Tenancy, Self-service and Existing identities
    - title: Integrate with all your systems
      description: Use our APIs, SDKs, and our quickstarts to enable modern authentication with any of your systems.
