    - title: Scheduled Archiving
      description: "ArchiveBox contains a built-in scheduler that supports pulling in URLs regularly from the web or from the local filesystem. ArchiveBox ignores links that are imported multiple times (keeping the earliest version that it's seen). This means you can add cron jobs that regularly poll the same file or URL for new links, adding only new ones as necessary, or you can pass --overwrite to save a fresh copy each time the scheduled task runs.Uses standard, durable, long-term formats"

    - title: Archive Layout
      description: "All of ArchiveBox's state (including the index, snapshot data, and config file) is stored in a single folder called the 'ArchiveBox data folder'. All archivebox CLI commands must be run from inside this folder, and you first create it by running archivebox init."
