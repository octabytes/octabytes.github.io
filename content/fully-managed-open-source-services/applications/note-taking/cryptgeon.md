  description: "Cryptgeon is an innovative, open-source note and file-sharing service that prioritizes security and privacy. Inspired by PrivNote, Cryptgeon allows users to send sensitive information with confidence, knowing that everything is encrypted on the client-side. Developed using Rust and Svelte, Cryptgeon ensures that the server cannot access the content due to its robust client-side encryption mechanism. It is designed for users who need a secure, temporary, and easy-to-use platform for sharing files or notes. Whether you need to send confidential text or files, Cryptgeon guarantees no persistence, meaning all data is erased once viewed.

With a focus on privacy, Cryptgeon provides optional view-time constraints and ensures that once the note or file is viewed, it cannot be accessed again. This service is perfect for individuals and businesses looking for secure communication without compromising on simplicity and ease of use."
