  description: "Quickwit is an innovative, cloud-native search engine that excels in observability and is the perfect solution for managing logs and traces. Built as an open-source alternative to Datadog, Elasticsearch, Loki, and Tempo, Quickwit is optimized for search performance on cloud storage, offering unmatched speed and efficiency. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Rust and the Tantivy search engine library, Quickwit enables ultra-fast, sub-second search capabilities on large volumes of data stored in cloud environments. Its decoupled storage and compute architecture ensure optimal performance and cost-efficiency, making it a powerful tool for organizations looking to enhance their log and trace management solutions.

With Quickwit, you can seamlessly store and search your data on unlimited, cost-effective cloud storage, while benefitting from features like schemaless indexing and native OpenTelemetry and Jaeger support. Whether you’re troubleshooting errors or analyzing logs at scale, Quickwit delivers unparalleled performance with lower costs compared to traditional search technologies. Easily deployable on-premise or in Kubernetes environments, Quickwit integrates with popular object storage solutions (Amazon S3, MinIO, Ceph) and distributed queues (Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis), making it an ideal choice for modern observability needs."
  features:
    - title: The Fastest Search Engine on Cloud Storage
      description: "Quickwit is powered by Tantivy, the fastest search engine library, and optimized with a smart I/O scheduling system that maximizes throughput. Written in Rust with no garbage collection, it provides vectorized processing and SIMD for lightning-fast search performance."
