  short_description: Fugu is a product analytics software with a strong focus on simplicity and privacy-friendliness.
  description: "Fugu is a simple, privacy-friendly, open source and self-hostable product analytics. The focus on privacy-friendliness and simplicity translates to a few things: First, Fugu never tracks any personally identifiable information such as IP addresses. Second, Fugu is made for people who don't need fancy product analytics tools but prefer a set of easy-to-use features over a complex user experience."
  features:
    - title: Track events
      description: Events are the fundament of Fugu. Use the name to describe your event, and the properties to save further data along with your event. In Fugu, you can analyze your data based on event names and properties.
    - title: Funnels
      description: After giving your Funnel a descriptive (or funny, or both) name, you can select up to 5 steps composing the funnel. Note that you need to select at least one step in order to create a new funnel.

      description: To send an event to the Fugu API, call the events endpoint /api/v1/events with a POST request that contains a body formatted as application/json.
    - title: Test and live modes
      description: "Each Fugu project has a test and live mode view. Events that you track using your live API key will be appear in live mode, and Events tracked with your test API key show up in the test mode. You can find your API keys in your Project settings.
