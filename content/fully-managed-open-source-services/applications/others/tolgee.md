  features:
    - title: In-context Translating
      description: "In-context translation ensures that your translations are accurate by providing translators with the context in which the text is used. This reduces the risk of errors and misunderstandings, enabling translations that reflect the true meaning of the content within your app’s layout and functionality."
    - title: Translation Memory
      description: "Tolgee's translation memory suggests previously used translations, making it easier to maintain consistency across your project. With similarity percentage indicators and original text references, you can quickly identify how to handle repetitive strings and ensure your translations are uniform."
    - title: Machine Translations
      description: "With integrated machine translation support, Tolgee accelerates the localization process by providing automatic translation suggestions powered by third-party services. This reduces the manual work required from human translators, allowing for faster project completion."
    - title: Auto Translation
      description: "Enable auto-translation in Tolgee to automatically translate newly added strings using either translation memory or machine translation. This ensures that all new content is instantly translated without requiring any manual input, keeping your project up-to-date with minimal effort."
    - title: Seamless Integration
      description: "Tolgee offers a developer-friendly integration process, allowing you to embed localization features into your web, mobile, or desktop application without modifying your existing codebase. The platform is built to fit smoothly into your existing development workflow."
