  short_description: Open-source developer & translator friendly localization platform üêÅ
  description: Tolgee is a localization platform that allows you to translate your application into any language without modifying your code. It is designed to be used with web applications, but it can be used also with mobile apps and desktop applications.  Tolgee is a developer-focused platform, so it is easy to integrate with your application. No more looking for keys in your source code, no more editing localization files, and no more manual exporting data for translators.
  features:
    - title: In-context translating
      description: "Translating in the context is the best way to avoid mistakes translators make because of missing context. Imagine you've got just words, strings, and phrases without knowing how they relate, what order they should be in, or where are they located in the app."
    - title: Translation memory
      description: Tolgee automatically makes suggestions from translations you already used in the project so you can translate similar phrases in a similar way.  Translation memory suggestions also show the similarity percentage, the key, and the original text of the translated string.
    - title: Machine translations
      description: The machine translation features make the whole localization process significantly faster. Translators can just use translation suggestions provided by third-party machine translation services.
    - title: Auto translation
      description: When enabled, Tolgee automatically translates new keys using translation memory or machine translation services. Your strings are translated immediately, right after creation.
