Customers and projects can be assigned to those teams, limiting visibility and access for other users."

Activities can also be global. No more duplications are necessary if your projects share the same working unit.
    - title: Multi-language

You connect your company's directory server (LDAP or Active Directory) to Kimai and use your existing authentication infrastructure."
