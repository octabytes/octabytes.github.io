  short_description: Penpot is the first open-source design and prototyping platform for cross-domain teams.
  description: "Penpot is a design and prototyping platform that does not depend on operating systems. It's web-based and works with open web standards (SVG). All team members can work simultaneously with the real-time design multiplayer and centralised comments, ideas and feedback right over the designs. With interactive prototypes, you can create rich interactions to mimic the product behaviour, share, present proposals to your team and start user testing with your designs, all in one place."
  features:
