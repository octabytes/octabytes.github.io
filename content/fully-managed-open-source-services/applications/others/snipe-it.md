  short_description: An IT asset/license management system
  description: Snipe-IT was made for IT asset management, to enable IT departments to track who has which laptop, when it was purchased, which software licenses and accessories are available, and so on.
  features:
    - title: Security
      description: Automated security controls are critical to any software workflow to reduce the amount of time from defect creation to defect detection. Our scans run on every code push, every time.
    - title: Admin Dashboard
      description: At-a-glance access to recent activity and an overall view of what assets, accessories, consumables, and components you have.  Items that have been checked in, checked out, recently updated or deleted, show up in a recent activity snapshot.
    - title: Asset Management
      description: "Easily see which assets are assigned, to whom, and their physical location. Check them back into inventory with one click, or click through to see the asset's complete history. Seeing what assets are currently deployed, pending (brand new awaiting software installs, out for repair), ready to deploy, or archived (lost/stolen, or broken) is quick and easy."
    - title: Integrations & Robust JSON REST API
      description: Easily integrate your own proprietary systems and workflows with a powerful REST API. And while the native API is straightforward and well-documented, new open source SDKs are being developed by the community all the time to make integration even easier.
