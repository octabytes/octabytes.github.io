  description: "PeerTube offers a powerful and decentralized alternative to centralized video platforms like YouTube, providing users with over 600,000 videos from more than 150,000 creators. With over 70 million views, PeerTube is revolutionizing the way we watch and share videos. Unlike traditional video platforms, PeerTube allows individuals to host their own video servers, known as instances, which are interconnected in a global federation. This decentralized approach ensures freedom of content, privacy for users, and a fairer system free from targeted ads and data tracking.

PeerTube is built with open-source, libre technology and is governed by a free and transparent licensing model. It enables video creators to choose their hosting providers based on values such as privacy, transparency, and fairness, giving them full control over their content. PeerTube is also integrated with ActivityPub, allowing seamless interaction with other federated platforms like Mastodon, creating a vibrant and interconnected online community. With PeerTube, video sharing is no longer controlled by large corporations, but instead is a community-driven, open platform that empowers users to create, share, and enjoy videos on their terms."
  features:
    - title: A Federation of Interconnected Hosting Services
      description: "PeerTube is designed to be a decentralized network of video hosting services. Anyone with technical skills can host their own PeerTube instance, creating a community-run platform where each instance is independently managed by administrators. This decentralized structure ensures diversity and reduces the risk of censorship."
    - title: This is Just How a Federation Works!
      description: "PeerTube uses the ActivityPub protocol, which allows it to federate with other compatible platforms. This means you can interact with users on Mastodon and other federated services. PeerTube users can follow accounts, view videos, and comment across the federated network, enhancing the community experience."
    - title: Open-Source, Free/Libre License Code
      description: "PeerTube is committed to freedom and privacy. Unlike proprietary video platforms, it operates under an open-source, free/libre license, meaning the source code is publicly available and can be audited. This ensures transparency, allowing users to trust that their data and interactions are not being exploited for targeted advertising."
    - title: Are You a Video Maker?
      description: "PeerTube offers video creators the freedom to choose a hosting provider that aligns with their values. Unlike YouTube, which enforces a centralized system for content control, PeerTube gives creators autonomy over their content, avoiding censorship and the controversial 'Robocopyright' system."
    - title: No Ads, Just Content
      description: "PeerTube eliminates intrusive ads and data tracking, offering a clean, user-friendly experience. By using a decentralized model, PeerTube ensures that content creators retain control over monetization and that viewers enjoy an uninterrupted viewing experience."
    - title: Privacy-Focused Platform
      description: "With PeerTube, your data is never sold to advertisers. The decentralized nature of the platform means there is no central authority tracking your activity. This ensures a more private, secure environment for both content creators and viewers, prioritizing user autonomy and confidentiality."
