  short_description: Open Source NoSQL Database
  description: Apache Cassandra is an open source NoSQL distributed database trusted by thousands of companies for scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.
  features:
    - title: Hybrid
      description: Masterless architecture and low latency mean Apache Cassandra will withstand an entire data center outage with no data lossâ€”across public or private clouds and on-premises.
    - title: Scalable
      description: Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added, with no downtime or interruption to applications.
    - title: Elastic
      description: Apache Cassandra streams data between nodes during scaling operations such as adding a new node or data center during peak traffic times. Zero Copy Streaming makes this up to 5x faster without vnodes for a more elastic architecture, particularly in cloud and Kubernetes environments.
    - title: High Availability and Fault Tolerance
      description: Another striking feature of Apache Cassandra is Data replication which makes Apache Cassandra highly available and fault-tolerant. Replication means each data is stored at more than one location. This is because, even if one node fails, the user should be able to retrieve the data with ease from another location. In an Apache Cassandra cluster, each row is replicated based on the row key. You can set the number of replicas you want to create. Just like scaling, data replication can also happen across multiple data centers. This further leads to high-level backup and recovery competencies in Cassandra.
