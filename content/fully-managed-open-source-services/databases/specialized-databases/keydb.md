  short_description: KeyDB is both your cache and database, for cloud-optimized solutions.
  description: KeyDB is a fully open source database, backed by Snap, and a faster drop in alternative to Redis. KeyDB is meant to handle heavy workloads with a single node benchmarking at over 1 million ops/sec. KeyDB is a multithreaded database and will outperform Redis on a per-node basis. By keeping data in-memory, KeyDB can serve up data with submillisecond latencies.
  features:
    - title: Variety of data structures supported
      description: A good range of data structures are supported such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes and streams.
    - title: Scalable
      description: With KeyDB, you can add more throughput with replica nodes and active-replica nodes, or partition the data in a sharded cluster.
    - title: High throughput
      description: KeyDB is meant to handle high work loads with an architecture that maximizes use of your systems resources. A single node benchmarks over 1 million ops/sec.
    - title: High availability
      description: Simplify your high-availability (HA) setup with active-replica nodes that do not require sentinel nodes for failover. HA setups are also available for sharded cluster mode configurations.
