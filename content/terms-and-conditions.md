# Terms and Conditions

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By using OctaByte’s services, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions. These terms apply to all users of the platform, including but not limited to customers, visitors, and vendors.

## 2. Service Overview

OctaByte provides fully managed hosting services for open-source community versions of software. OctaByte does not own or develop the software offered and is not responsible for any issues related to the performance or functionality of the software itself. The service is limited to hosting, managing, and maintaining servers and updates for the hosted software.

## 3. Pricing and Payment

OctaByte offers transparent, subscription-based pricing starting at $9 per month for shared servers. Additional pricing may apply for custom server specifications based on customer requirements. All payments are non-refundable, except in cases of service errors or violations on OctaByte’s end.

## 4. Server and Application Management

OctaByte will manage server operations, including setting up, maintaining, and updating the server infrastructure. Updates to open-source applications will be provided at no additional cost. Customers are responsible for any additional software or custom configurations they wish to install on their server.

## 5. Customization and Scaling

Customers have the option to upgrade server specifications based on their usage and system load requirements. Contact OctaByte for any special server configurations. All changes to server specs may result in a change in the pricing plan.

## 6. Data Ownership and Migration

All data hosted on OctaByte servers belongs to the customer. Customers have the right to migrate their data away from OctaByte at any time without any vendor lock-in. OctaByte will provide reasonable assistance during migrations, but the customer is ultimately responsible for any migration-related tasks.

## 7. Data Backup and Restoration

OctaByte provides a 7-day backup for customer data. However, in certain rare cases where data restoration may not be possible, OctaByte cannot be held responsible. While such incidents are uncommon, customers acknowledge that if a backup cannot be restored, they have no claim against OctaByte for any data loss resulting from an unsuccessful restoration attempt.

## 8. Subscription Cancellation

Customers may cancel their subscription at any time. If canceled during the trial period, no charges will apply. However, once the trial period ends, charges for the month are non-refundable. For example, if a customer on a monthly plan ($15) cancels their subscription on the 15th of the month, the service will continue until the end of the month, but no partial refund will be given. From the next month, no further charges will be applied, and services will cease.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

OctaByte is not responsible for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the service, including but not limited to issues related to software performance, server downtime, or data loss.

## 10. Service Availability

While OctaByte strives to provide continuous uptime for its services, there may be occasional downtime due to maintenance, upgrades, or unforeseen technical issues. OctaByte will make reasonable efforts to notify customers of planned maintenance in advance.

## 11. Usage Restrictions

Users may not use OctaByte’s services for any illegal or unethical activities, including but not limited to hacking, distributing malicious software, or violating the intellectual property rights of others. OctaByte reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts involved in such activities without notice.

## 12. Changes to Terms

OctaByte reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time. Continued use of the service after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

## 13. Termination and Data Loss Disclaimer

OctaByte reserves the right to terminate services at its discretion, including but not limited to situations where continued service is deemed unfeasible. In such cases, customers acknowledge that OctaByte may or may not provide access to service data. Additionally, while OctaByte strives to prevent data loss, customers agree that OctaByte is not liable for any claims arising from service termination or data loss. Refunds in such cases are at OctaByte's sole discretion and may or may not be provided.
