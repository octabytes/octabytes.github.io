"Keycloak

Keycloak allows single sign-on with identity and access management. You can add authentication to applications and secure services with minimum fuss. There's no need to deal with storing or authenticating users. It's all available out of the box. You also get advanced features such as user federation, identity brokering and social login.

Features Highlight:

- Single sign-on/out:

Users authenticate with Keycloak rather than individual applications. This means that your applications don't have to deal with login forms, authenticating users, and storing users. Once logged in to Keycloak, users don't have to log in again to access a different application. This also applies to logging out. The single sign-out means users only have to log out once to be logged out of all applications that use Keycloak.

- Identity brokering and social login:

With Keycloak, enabling login with social networks is easy to add through the admin console ‚Äì just select the social network you want to add. No code or changes to your application are required. Keycloak can also authenticate users with OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 identity providers. Again, this is just a matter of configuring the identity provider through the admin console.

- User federation:

Keycloak has built-in support to connect to LDAP or Active Directory servers. You can also implement your own provider if you have users in other stores, such as a relational database.

- Admin console:

Through the admin console administrators can centrally manage all aspects of the Keycloak server: enable and disable various features; configure identity brokering and user federation; create and manage applications and services; define fine-grained authorization policies, and manage users, including permissions and sessions.

- Discuss code:

Read old and new versions of files with syntax highlighting and colored differences. Discuss specific sections with others to make the right changes.

- Manage and serve Git repositories:

Gerrit includes Git-enabled SSH and HTTPS servers compatible with all Git clients. Simplify management by hosting many Git repositories together.

- Extensible through plugins:

Gerrit Code Review can be extended and further customized by installing server-side plugins. Source code for additional plugins can be found through the project listing

"Rstudio

RStudio is a powerful and easy way to interact with R programming, considered as Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a one-stop solution for all the statistical computing and graphics. The RStudio is a more advanced version of R that comes with a multi-pane window setup that provides access to all primary things on a single screen (such as source, console, environment & history, files, photos, graphs, etc).

Features Highlight:

- RStudio is designed to make it easy to write scripts:

As soon as you create a new script, the windows within your RStudio session adjust automatically so you can see both your script and the results in your console when you run your syntax.

Even better is the ability to call up potential syntax options while you are writing just by using the tab key.

- RStudio makes it convenient to view and interact with the objects stored in your environment:

In the basic R GUI, you can always list the objects you have stored in your environment. But RStudio has a very useful ‚ÄúEnvironment‚Äù window available.

This shows all of the objects that you have stored, including data; scalars, vectors, and matrices; model outputs; etc., along with a summary of the information that is stored in those objects.

- Reproducible research:

You‚Äôve loaded your data on your experimental patients into SPSS, rearranged it as needed, inspected the summary statistics, deleted several cases with missing values, run the model, and observed some very strange results. You suspect there was a mistake in your data analysis process and want to discuss this issue with your colleague.

- Advanced visualizations:

Even the basic functionality of R allows you to create histograms, scatterplots, or line plots with only a tiny bit of code. These are very convenient functions for visualizing your data before even starting any analysis. In a few seconds you can actually see your data and get insights that are not visible from the tabulated data alone.

"Vault

Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

Features Highlight:

- Secure Secret Storage:

Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets.

- Dynamic Secrets:

Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases

- Data Encryption:

Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without having to design their own encryption methods.

- Leasing and Renewal:

All secrets in Vault have a¬†lease¬†associated with it. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.

"Appsmith

Appsmith is a low-code, open-source framework to build internal applications. With the JavaScript-based visual development platform, you can rapidly build CRUD apps, dashboards, admin panels, etc. You can use the pre-built UI widgets, and connect them to your APIs and databases to build dynamic apps and complex workflows ‚Äì and then deploy these apps on the technology you prefer.

Features Highlight:

- Use ready components:

Appsmith enables you to build workflows in record time. You can drag common elements (tables, charts, forms, etc) right into your app, including text, forms, inputs, buttons, tables, images, charts, checkboxes, switches, radio buttons, datepickers, dropdowns, filepickers, containers, maps, modals, rich text editors, tabs and video.

- Automagically works using any DB:

Appsmith integrates with any DB, Rest API or GraphQL as a datasource, with support for OAuth 2.0 and CURL. It works with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Firestore, S3, Redshift, Elastic Search, DynamoDB, Redis, and MSFT SQL Server.

- Control and connect with JS:

You can code interactions between elements, update datasources or manipulate SQL queries. Every entity in Appsmith can be referenced as a JavaScript variable, and all JavaScript functions and operations can be performed on them. This means that all widgets, APIs, queries and their associated data and properties can be referenced anywhere in an application inside handlebars.

- Deploy and share:

You can allow external users to access applications built using Appsmith by inviting them to the organization. Appsmith implements RBAC by assigning a set of permissions to different user roles. These permissions determine the actions users can take on the platform.
