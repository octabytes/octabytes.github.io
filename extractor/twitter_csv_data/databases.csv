"PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source, object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. It has a strong reputation for its architecture, reliability, data integrity, robust feature set and extensibility. It runs on all major operating systems, is ACID-compliant, and has powerful add-ons such as the PostGIS geospatial database extender.

Features Highlight:

- Wide range of data types:

PostgreSQL is one of the most advanced open-source databases, with numerous data types and functions added over the years. Data types include: Primitives: Integer, Numeric, String, Boolean. Structured: Date/Time, Array, Range / Multirange, UUID. Document: JSON/JSONB, XML, Key-value (Hstore). Geometry: Point, Line, Circle, Polygon. Customizations: Composite, Custom Types.

- Data integrity:

PostgreSQL strives to conform to the ANSI-SQL:2008 standard, is fully ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) compliant, and is well-known for its rock-solid referential and transactional integrity. Its data integrity features ensure only validated data is stored.

- High security:

All files stored in the database are protected from reading by any account other than the superuser account. Authentication is ensured via: GSSAPI, SSPI, LDAP, SCRAM-SHA-256, Certificate, and more; a robust access-control system; column and row-level security; and multi-factor authentication with certificates.

- Extensibility:

PostgreSQL is extensible because its operation is catalog-driven, with stored functions and procedures; Procedural Languages (PL/PGSQL, Perl, Python, etc);  SQL/JSON path expressions; foreign data wrappers; customizable storage interface for tables, and many extensions that provide additional functionality, including PostGIS.

"MySQL

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Many of the world's largest organizations rely on it to power their high-volume websites, business-critical systems and packaged software. It runs on almost all platforms, including Linux, UNIX and Windows.

Features Highlight:

- Fast and reliable:

MySQL was developed for speed, even if this may come at the expense of some additional features. It is also known for its reliability as a database administrator, backed by a large community of programmers that have put the code through tough testing. Another benefit is that it is relatively simple to learn and use. And as it has been around for nearly three decades, it’s not hard to find experienced MySQL developers when you need them.

- Availability:

Online businesses and web platforms need to be able to provide round-the-clock services for a global audience. This is why high availability is a core feature of MySQL. It uses a range of cluster servers and data replication configurations that ensure uninterrupted uptime even if there is a failure. MySQL also uses a variety of backup and recovery strategies to ensure data is not lost in the event of a system crash or unintentional delete.

- Scalability:

As data volumes and user loads increase, the database store needs to be scaled-up. It must be able to cope with the additional workload without a drop in performance.  MySQL can be scaled in different ways, typically via replication, clustering or sharding (or a combination of them). It is able to support and process very large databases, though this is likely to have an impact on speed.

- Security:

This is always an important consideration for businesses as they need to protect sensitive data and defend against cyberattacks. MySQL offers encryption using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, data masking, authentication plugins, and other layers of security to protect data integrity. The MySQL Enterprise package also includes firewall protection against cyberattacks.

"Cassandra

Apache Cassandra is an open source NoSQL distributed database trusted by thousands of companies for scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.

Features Highlight:

- Hybrid:

Masterless architecture and low latency mean Apache Cassandra will withstand an entire data center outage with no data loss—across public or private clouds and on-premises.

- Scalable:

Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added, with no downtime or interruption to applications.

- Elastic:

Apache Cassandra streams data between nodes during scaling operations such as adding a new node or data center during peak traffic times. Zero Copy Streaming makes this up to 5x faster without vnodes for a more elastic architecture, particularly in cloud and Kubernetes environments.

- High Availability and Fault Tolerance:

Another striking feature of Apache Cassandra is Data replication which makes Apache Cassandra highly available and fault-tolerant. Replication means each data is stored at more than one location. This is because, even if one node fails, the user should be able to retrieve the data with ease from another location. In an Apache Cassandra cluster, each row is replicated based on the row key. You can set the number of replicas you want to create. Just like scaling, data replication can also happen across multiple data centers. This further leads to high-level backup and recovery competencies in Cassandra.

immudb is a immutable ledger database that has been developed with performance, scalability and versatility in mind. The user feedback has shown that they love the very high throughput and being able to store hashes as well as data. They see it as a great alternative to using a blockchain or ledger service.

Features Highlight:

- Keep track of changes and audit them.:

Traditional database transactions and logs are hard to scale and are mutable, so there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised. immudb is immutable. You can add new versions of existing records, but never change or delete records. This lets you store critical data without fear of it being changed silently.

- Verify your data without sacrificing performance:

Data stored in immudb is cryptographically coherent and verifiable, just like blockchains, but without all the complexity. Unlike blockchains, immudb can handle millions of transactions per second, and can be used both as a lightweight service or embedded in your application as a library.

- Protect yourself from supply-chain attacks:

While Cyber Security is an important part of your organization’s business plan, immudb provides another layer of security to ensure data integrity even in the event your perimeter is breached during an attack. Data cannot be deleted or modified once stored into immudb. Additions of new data are logged and auditable, enabling you to view any suspect additions made during the intrusion.

- KEY VALUE AND SQL:

immudb can be used as a tamper-proof key value store or SQL database, with audit history capabilities. Within single immudb instance a user can have multiple databases of both types, it is even possible to have KV and SQL withing single database.Key value is a foundation layer for SQL, meaning that SQL is using key value store capabilities underneath.
