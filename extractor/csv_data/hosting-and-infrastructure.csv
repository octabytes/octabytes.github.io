"Loki

Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost-effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

Features Highlight:

- Pull in any logs with Promtail:

Promtail is a log collector built specifically for Loki. It uses the same service discovery as Prometheus and includes analogous features for labeling, transforming, and filtering logs before ingestion into Loki.

- Store the logs in Loki:

Loki does not index the text of logs. Instead, entries are grouped into streams and indexed with labels. Not only does this reduce costs, but it also means log lines are available to query within milliseconds of being received by Loki.

- Use LogQL to explore:

Use Loki’s powerful query language, LogQL, to explore your logs. Run LogQL queries directly within Grafana to visualize your logs alongside other data sources, or with LogCLI, for those who prefer a command-line experience.

- Alert on your logs:

Set up alerting rules for Loki to evaluate your incoming log data. Configure Loki to send the resulting alerts to a Prometheus Alert manager so they can then get routed to the right team.

"Prometheus

Prometheus, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project, is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.

Features Highlight:

- Data model:

Prometheus fundamentally stores all data as time series: streams of timestamped values belonging to the same metric and the same set of labeled dimensions. Besides stored time series, Prometheus may generate temporary derived time series as the result of queries.

- Querying prometheus:

Prometheus provides a functional query language called PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) that lets the user select and aggregate time series data in real time. The result of an expression can either be shown as a graph, viewed as tabular data in Prometheus's expression browser, or consumed by external systems via the HTTP API.

- Grafana support for prometheus:

Grafana supports querying Prometheus. The Grafana data source for Prometheus is included since Grafana 2.5.0 (2015-10-28).

The following shows an example Grafana dashboard which queries Prometheus for data:

- Configuration:

Prometheus is configured via command-line flags and a configuration file. While the command-line flags configure immutable system parameters (such as storage locations, amount of data to keep on disk and in memory, etc.), the configuration file defines everything related to scraping jobs and their instances, as well as which rule files to load.

This architecture has proved to be successful and has spawned the creation of thousands of addon projects that extend its core feature set.

- General Scope:

The scope of Nagios Core is primarily focused the duties of check scheduling, check execution, check processing, event handling, and alerting. Performing checks, sending notifications, processing performance data, and many other tasks are generally out-of-scope for Nagios Core and are handled by other Nagios projects.

- Frontends:

Nagios Core has historically and still does ship with a default CGI interface. The CGIs provide Nagios users with the basic functionality required to view and manage elements that are monitored by Nagios Core. The CGIs have become the standard Nagios Core interface and are often used as an API by many Nagios extensions. Many users deploy additional frontends to customize the look, feel, and functionality of their Nagios UI. Nagios V-Shell is a new frontend that is currently being developed as the official PHP frontend to Nagios Core.

- Extended Features:

There is a rich variety of addons that provide additional features that are out-of-scope for Nagios Core itself, including configuration frontends, performance graphing, auto-discovery, and distributed monitoring, among others. These features are implemented in different Nagios projects, which are developed independently and can be found at Nagios Exchange.

- In control:

In Syncthing, you set up both sides to connect two devices. An attacker can’t do much with a stolen device ID, because you have to add the device on the other side too. You have better control where your files are transferred.

- Rapid synchronization:

Syncthing segments files into pieces, called blocks, to transfer data from one device to another. Therefore, multiple devices can share the synchronization load, in a similar way to the Torrent protocol. The more devices you have online, the faster an additional device will receive the data because small blocks will be fetched from all devices in parallel.

"OpenResty

OpenResty is a full-fledged web platform that integrates our enhanced version of the Nginx core, our enhanced version of LuaJIT, many carefully written Lua libraries, lots of high quality 3rd-party Nginx modules, and most of their external dependencies. It is designed to help developers easily build scalable web applications, web services, and dynamic web gateways.

Features Highlight:

- Powerful web app server:

By taking advantage of various well-designed Nginx modules (most of which are developed by the OpenResty team themselves), OpenResty effectively turns the nginx server into a powerful web app server, in which the web developers can use the Lua programming language to script various existing nginx C modules and Lua modules and construct extremely high-performance web applications that are capable to handle 1000K+ connections in a single box.

- Automated SSL Termination:

OpenResty will automatically create and renew SSL certificates

- Extensible:

Leverage tons of LUA plugins available or write your own LUA code. It's easy and very fast.

- Based on Nginx:

Switching from nginx to OpenResty is not such a paradigm shift as moving to, say, Apache or Microsoft IIS. The OpenResty web application platform is built around the standard nginx core, which offers some familiarity, as well as allowing the use of third-party nginx modules.

"Squid

Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages. Squid has extensive access controls and makes a great server accelerator.

Features Highlight:

- Simple & powerful:

Squid is one of the oldest content accelerators, used by thousands of websites around the world to ease the load on their servers. Setting up an accelerator in front of an existing website is almost always a quick and simple task with immediate benefits.

- Improve user experience:

A well-tuned proxy server (even without caching!) can improve user speeds purely by optimising TCP flows. Its easy to tune servers to deal with the wide variety of latencies found on the internet - something that desktop environments just aren't tuned for.

- Hundreds of features and options:

Advanced ACL to Allow/Block based on network, Caching, Content filtering, load balancing, Clustering, Traffic Interception and many more

- Advanced authentication systems:

Set authentication to get users to Authenticate (LDAP, Active Directory,RADIUS, POP3, DB, etc)
