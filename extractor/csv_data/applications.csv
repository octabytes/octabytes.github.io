When someone quotes your post, we’ll notify you. When someone mentions your @name, we’ll notify you. When someone replies to your post… well, you get the idea. And if you’re not around, we’ll email you, too.

- Simple, but with context:

Discourse is a simple, flat forum, where replies flow down the page in a line. Expand context at the bottom and top of each post, and also in quotes, to reveal the full conversation without losing your place.

- Links automatically expand:

Want to share a cool link you found? Just paste it in on a single line and we’ll make it awesome. Links to Wikipedia, YouTube, Amazon, GitHub, Twitter, Flickr, and hundreds of other popular websites automatically expand to provide additional context and information.

"Wordpress-Multisites

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Multisite is a type of WordPress installation that allows you to create and manage a network of multiple websites from a single WordPress dashboard. This lets you easily make changes and keep your websites updated from one place. You can create a multisite network alone or add other users who can create their own sites inside your network, limiting them from accessing more powerful WordPress features.

Features Highlight:

- Many sites, one dashboard:

WordPress multisite networks are a great option for those wanting to manage separate websites from one dashboard. Multisite networks are used by corporations, schools, universities, news outlets, online businesses, etc. You can also create your own blogging platform (network of blogs) on a single multisite installation.

- Choose a number…:

You can host a virtually unlimited number of sites in a Multisite setup, thus saving the expense and time of creating separate web hosting accounts and individual websites that need to be managed on their own. The number of sites and amount of content they can contain are limited only by the resources, such as storage and bandwidth, available to the main site through its hosting provider.

- Lots of uses:

Multisite can be used for various purposes. 1) Education portals can create a single “hub” site that hosts the websites of multiple instructors or classes so that students can get a consistent experience across all of them, and instructors don’t need to direct students to their own personal sites. 2) It can be useful for training users in coding, etc, by making it possible to set up multiple test sites under one master site. 3) Design businesses and other kinds of companies can provide clients with a managed site for blogging or other purposes related to doing business with the parent company. 4) Multisite can be used to set up a commercial web network in which users pay a subscription fee to have their own site hosted in the network. Finally, 5) A company with multiple employees or contractors who deal independently with customers or clients might use Multisite to allow each of these professionals to set up an individual site under the brand of the main site.

- Built-in blog, ready to go:

Since WordPress was originally created as a blogging platform, blogging capabilities are built in and easy to integrate, if desired. It's also easy to set up RSS/email subscriptions to your blog and commenting capabilities, and automatically add the most recent blog posts to other pages of the site (your home page, for example). This helps to extend your reach and make your site more dynamic and interactive.

"PeerTube

PeerTube is the free and decentralized alternative to video platforms, providing you over 600,000 videos published by 150,000 users and viewed over 70 million times.

Features Highlight:

- A federation of interconnected hosting services:

PeerTube is not meant to become a huge platform that would centralize videos from all around the world.
Anyone with a modicum of technical skills can host a PeerTube server, aka an instance. Each instance hosts its users and their videos. In this way, every instance is created, moderated and maintained independently by various administrators.

- This is just how a federation works!:

PeerTube uses ActivityPub, a federating protocol that allows you to interact with other software, provided they also use this protocol. For example, PeerTube and Mastodon -a Twitter alternative- are connected: you can follow a PeerTube user from Mastodon (the latest videos from the PeerTube account you follow will appear in your feed), and even comment on a PeerTube-hosted video directly from your Mastodon's account.

- Open-source, free/libre license code:

Mainstream online video broadcasting services make money off of your data by analyzing your interactions so that they can then bombard your with targeted advertising.

- Are you a video maker?:

With PeerTube, choose your hosting company and the rules you believe in.
YouTube has clearly gone astray: its hoster, Google-Alphabet, can enforce its ContentID system (the infamous ""Robocopyright"") or its videos recommendation system, all of which appear to be as obscure as unfair.

"Airflow

When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative. Use Apache Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The Apache Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.

Features Highlight:

- Pure Python:

No more command-line or XML black-magic! Use standard Python features to create your workflows, including date time formats for scheduling and loops to dynamically generate tasks. This allows you to maintain full flexibility when building your workflows.

- Useful UI:

Monitor, schedule and manage your workflows via a robust and modern web application. No need to learn old, cron-like interfaces. You always have full insight into the status and logs of completed and ongoing tasks.

- Robust Integrations:

Apache Airflow provides many plug-and-play operators that are ready to execute your tasks on Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and many other third-party services. This makes Apache Airflow easy to apply to current infrastructure and extend to next-gen technologies.

- Easy to Use:

Anyone with Python knowledge can deploy a workflow. Apache Airflow does not limit the scope of your pipelines; you can use it to build ML models, transfer data, manage your infrastructure, and more.
