      WordPress is very easy to use and has an intuitive interface. It's easy to
      quickly add new pages, blog posts, images, etc. Since the technology is so
      simple, the time spent on formatting is greatly reduced.

      The code behind WordPress is clean and simple, making it easy for search
      engines to read and index a site's content. In addition, each page, post
      and image can have its own meta tag keywords, description and title, and
      be optimized for specific keywords. This enables very precise
      search-engine optimization (SEO). You can also use tags to further enhance
      your SEO efforts.

      You don't have to wait for your web designer to make simple updates to
      your site. With WordPress, you have control of nearly every aspect of your
      site and can easily make those simple updates yourself.

      Since WordPress was originally created as a blogging platform, blogging
      capabilities are built in and easy to integrate, if desired. It's also
      easy to set up RSS/email subscriptions to your blog and commenting
      capabilities, and automatically add the most recent blog posts to other
      pages of the site (your home page, for example). This helps to extend your
      reach and make your site more dynamic and interactive.
