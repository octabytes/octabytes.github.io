  short_description: Apache Airflow is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.
  description: When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative. Use Apache Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The Apache Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.
  features:
    - title: Pure Python
      description: No more command-line or XML black-magic! Use standard Python features to create your workflows, including date time formats for scheduling and loops to dynamically generate tasks. This allows you to maintain full flexibility when building your workflows.
    - title: Useful UI
      description: Monitor, schedule and manage your workflows via a robust and modern web application. No need to learn old, cron-like interfaces. You always have full insight into the status and logs of completed and ongoing tasks.
    - title: Robust Integrations
      description: Apache Airflow provides many plug-and-play operators that are ready to execute your tasks on Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and many other third-party services. This makes Apache Airflow easy to apply to current infrastructure and extend to next-gen technologies.
    - title: Easy to Use
      description: Anyone with Python knowledge can deploy a workflow. Apache Airflow does not limit the scope of your pipelines; you can use it to build ML models, transfer data, manage your infrastructure, and more.
