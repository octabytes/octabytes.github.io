  features:
    - title: Visual Model Support
      description: "LobeChat now supports OpenAI's latest gpt-4-vision model with visual recognition capabilities, a multimodal intelligence that can perceive visuals. Users can easily upload or drag and drop images into the dialogue box, and the agent will be able to recognize the content of the images and engage in intelligent conversation based on this, creating smarter and more diversified chat scenarios."
    - title: TTS & STT Voice Speech
      description: LobeChat supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies, enabling our application to convert text messages into clear voice outputs, allowing users to interact with our conversational agent as if they were talking to a real person. Users can choose from a variety of voices to pair with the agent.
    - title: Text to Image
      description: With support for the latest text-to-image generation technology, LobeChat now allows users to invoke image creation tools directly within conversations with the agent. By leveraging the capabilities of AI tools such as DALL-E 3, MidJourney, and Pollinations, the agents are now equipped to transform your ideas into images.
    - title: Function Calling Plugin System
      description: The plugin ecosystem of LobeChat is a significant extension of its core functionalities, greatly enhancing the practicality and flexibility of ChatGPT. By leveraging plugins, ChatGPT can perform real-time information retrieval and processing, such as automatically fetching the latest news headlines to provide users with immediate and relevant information. Moreover, these plugins are not limited to news aggregation but can also extend to other practical functions, such as quick document retrieval, e-commerce platform data access, and various third-party services.
