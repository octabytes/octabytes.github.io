      description: "We've built Mapzy with privacy in mind. We only set one essential cookie, we don't track your visitors and never will. It's worth noting that our mapping service provider - Mapbox - collects some anonymous technical data, that we can not disable. Learn more in our privacy policy. Mapzy is also fully compliant with GDPR, so you don't have to show an ugly cookie pop-up to your customers."

The managed version of Mapzy is hosted on a data center in Frankfurt, Germany, which is powered by 100% renewable energy. But if you like, you can also host it yourself for free with the same features and without any restrictions. If you're a developer, you're very welcome to contribute to Mapzy, too!"
