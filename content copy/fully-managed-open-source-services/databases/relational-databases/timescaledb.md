  short_description: TimescaleDB is the leading open-source relational database with support for time-series data.
  description: TimescaleDB is  an open-source database designed to make SQL scalable for time-series data. It is engineered up from PostgreSQL and packaged as a PostgreSQL extension, providing automatic partitioning across time and space (partitioning key), as well as full SQL support.
  features:
    - title: Supercharged PostgreSQL
      description: "With TimescaleDB, you can rely on the same PostgreSQL you're familiar with, with full SQL, rock-solid reliability, and a massive ecosystem."
    - title: Accelerated performance
      description: You can achieve 10-100x faster queries than with PostgreSQL, InfluxDB and MongoDB, and benefit from native optimizations for time-series.
    - title: Massive scale
      description: TimescaleDB allows you to write millions of data points per second per node. You can horizontally scale to petabytes, and need not worry about cardinality.
    - title: Relational & time-series combined
      description: Since SQL JOINS are natively supported in TimescaleDB, data from different sources can be combined at query time (e.g. combining relational data stored in PostgreSQL tables with time-series data stored in TimescaleDB hypertables). This ability to store relational data alongside time-series data enables developers to simplify their stack, potentially reducing complex polyglot architectures to a single operational analytical database. This enables you to build more powerful applications.
