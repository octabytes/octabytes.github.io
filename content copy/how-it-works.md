# How it Works

## Overview

OctaByte is a fully managed platform designed to help you deploy and manage your favorite open-source applications with ease. We don't develop or own the software we provide — instead, we offer hosting for popular community versions of open-source applications that are developed and maintained by their respective communities.

## Hassle-Free Software Management

Our service allows you to run these open-source apps without the hassle of managing servers or updates. OctaByte handles everything from server setup to software management, ensuring you can focus on using the tools you love. By default, for just $9, you get access to a server, but we also offer custom server configurations based on your specific requirements. Contact with support for custom server. <a href="mailto:support@octabyte.io">support@octabyte.io</a>

## Full Community Version, No Restrictions

Unlike other services that limit features or charge high fees for hosted versions of open-source software, OctaByte provides you with the full, unrestricted community version of the software at an affordable price. You'll have access to all features, updates, and new releases at no additional cost.

## Simple, Transparent Pricing

Our pricing starts at $9 with no hidden fees, and you can scale your server as your needs grow. Plus, your data belongs to you — you can migrate away from OctaByte at any time without any vendor lock-in.
